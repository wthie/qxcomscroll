run the server with

python runqxcomscroll.py

which starts the server and let it bind to all interfaces on port 7999

Looking at the sole (single page webapp) page served on

http://localhost:7999

The run.tac file is provided as a configuration file for the twistd script
allowing for clean server operation with process right schedding (demotion)
logging and whatever the swerver admin's heart desires. For more knowledge
than simple try outs pleas head over to

A word to the additional package used in here, called nevow.

I used my own version which is used in production, compared to the original
it has some adaptions and also shortcomings which over the course of time 
will be ironed out. The idea is to continue working on nevow as long as the
two differ and bring them into sync.
