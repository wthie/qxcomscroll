# qxcomscroll
Minimal qooxdoo/twisted/nevow blend showing the sync'ed inband push of content to the browser

Single page web app showing some content scrolling in sync across several browsers and devices

run the server with

python runqxcomscroll.py

which starts the server and let it bind to all interfaces on port 7999

Looking at the sole (single page webapp) page served on

http://localhost:7999

The run.tac file is provided as a configuration file for the twistd script
allowing for clean server operation with process right schedding (demotion)
logging and whatever the swerver admin's heart desires. For more knowledge
than simple try outs pleas head over to 

http://twistedmatrix.com

The python dependencies which can be installed with pip are twisted and nevow.

The only external additional dependency is qooxdoo from http://qooxdoo.org

The final directory structure should be:
    qxcomscroll
    qooxdoo
        qooxdoo-sdk-5.0.1
        
 The internal qooxdoo bridging app must be regenerated by navigating into the
 
     qxcomscroll/js.src/qxcomscroll/qxathena
     
 then run the generator with
 
     python generator.py source
     
 and 
     python generator.py build
